(ns tapestry.core
  "Core namespace of Tapestry — structured concurrency over core.async fibers.

  Tapestry models a unit of concurrent work as a `fiber`: a derefable handle
  whose body runs on its own thread. Results, errors, timeouts, and
  cancellation all flow through that handle.

  On Jolt there is no JVM thread interruption, so `interrupt!`/`timeout!`
  deliver a cancellation to the fiber's result (a `deref` then sees it) but
  cannot forcibly stop a body blocked on `Thread/sleep`. Cooperative bodies —
  those that park on channel operations or check a cancellation flag — stop
  promptly; a body pinned in a blocking call runs to completion in the
  background while its result is reported as cancelled."
