(defmacro with-scope
  "Execute body within a structured scope that manages fiber lifecycles.

  Takes an options map with the following keys:
    :shutdown        - Shutdown policy: :on-failure or :on-success (optional)
    :timeout         - Timeout in millis or a Duration applied to all fibers (optional)
    :max-parallelism - Maximum number of fibers running in parallel (optional)

  All fibers created with `tapestry.core/fiber` within the body are
  automatically registered with the scope.

  On scope exit:
    - All registered fibers are awaited (their results settle)
    - If :shutdown is :on-failure and any fiber failed, the error is propagated
    - If :shutdown is :on-success, the first successful result is available

  Example:
    (with-scope {:timeout 5000 :shutdown :on-failure :max-parallelism 4}
      (let [a (fiber (do-a))
